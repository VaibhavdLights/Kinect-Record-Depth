### Depth Data Recorder using Kinect

This Python script captures depth data from a Kinect sensor and saves it to a binary file. It utilizes the `PyKinect2` library to interact with the Kinect sensor and `OpenCV` for some image processing.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `PyKinect2` library
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`

#### Installation
1. Install Python 3.x if you haven't already.
2. Install `PyKinect2`, `numpy`, and `opencv-python` using pip:
    ```
    pip install pykinect2 numpy opencv-python
    ```

#### Usage
1. Connect your Kinect sensor to your computer.
2. Run the script.
3. The script will continuously capture depth frames from the Kinect and save them to a binary file named `depth_data.bin`.
4. To stop recording, press `Ctrl + C`.

#### Possible Errors and Solutions

1. **Wrong Version Error**: This error might occur due to version conflicts. To resolve this:
    - Navigate to the `comtypes` library's `__init__.py` file.
    - Comment out the version check condition. For example:
        ```python
        # if sys.version_info >= (3, 8):
        #     os.add_dll_directory(os.path.dirname(__file__))
        ```
    - Sample path: `/path/to/your/python/lib/site-packages/comtypes/__init__.py`

2. For other errors, refer to the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Kinect/PyKinect2/issues) page of the `PyKinect2` library for possible solutions.

#### Important Notes
- Ensure that your Kinect sensor is properly connected and configured.
- Make sure to have sufficient disk space for saving the depth data.
- This script captures depth data only. Additional modifications are needed to capture other types of data.

#### Disclaimer
- This script is provided as-is without any warranty. Use it at your own risk.

### Depth Data Processing and Visualization

This set of Python scripts is designed to process and visualize depth data captured from a Kinect sensor. It includes scripts for both processing the depth data captured and for later visualizing the processed data.

#### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `opencv-python`

#### Processing Script

This script reads depth data from a binary file, processes it, and saves the processed images as a NumPy binary file.

#### Visualization Script

This script loads processed depth images from a saved file and visualizes them using OpenCV.

#### Usage
1. Ensure you have captured depth data using the provided recording script.
2. Run the processing script to process the captured depth data and save the processed images.
3. Run the visualization script to visualize the processed depth images.
